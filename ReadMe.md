# Education Project

This is my **education project**.  
Currently, I am developing data structures in Python.

## Structures

### 1) Linear
- **LinkedList**
- **DoublyLinkedList**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Dequeue**

### 2) Tree
- **BinarySearchTree**

## Description

This project contains implementations of classic data structures as part of my learning process.  
Each structure is implemented in a way that allows testing, iteration, and educational experimentation.

## Usage

```python
from edualg.structures.linear.LinkedList import LinkedList

ll = LinkedList()
ll.append(1)
ll.append(2)
print(list(ll))
